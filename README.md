# My Colang Mnsr

## Origin of the Name

The name **Mnsr** comes from the initials of the four core pronouns in the language:

- **Me** – the self (any subject)

- **Ne** – the other (you)

- **Se** – the trusted or knowable third (it)

- **Re** – the unknown, unreliable, or alien third (it)

Together, these represent the basic relational structure between subject, object, and environment in Mnsr.

## Language Philosophy

Mnsr is a constructed language (conlang) designed for:

- **Ease of Learning**  
  Minimal phonemes, consistent spelling, and no irregular rules. Pronunciation is tolerant and accessible to all.

- **Logical Precision**  
  Each word has a distinct, rule-based structure. Meaning is derived from grammar and morphology rather than cultural idioms.

- **Emotional Neutrality**  
  Mnsr avoids gender, social hierarchy, and culturally specific metaphors. It is a clean slate for thought.

- **Expandability**  
  The system allows for modular growth—new words and structures can be added without disrupting existing grammar.

- **Phonemic Simplicity**  
  What you see is what you pronounce. Every letter has one sound; every sound has one letter.

This language is an experiment in building a tool for clear, equitable communication—detached from any existing national language system or cultural authority.
