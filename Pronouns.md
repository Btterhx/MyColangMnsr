# Personal Pronouns in Mnsr

Mnsr uses four core personal pronouns. Each represents a relational category rather than grammatical person or gender. All pronouns are neutral and context-based.

## Core Subject Pronouns

| Pronoun | Meaning                                           |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Me**  | the self (any subject)                            |
| **Ne**  | the other, you                                    |
| **Se**  | the trusted or knowable third (it/she/he)         |
| **Re**  | the unknown, unreliable, or alien third (it)      |

These forms are used as the grammatical subject in a sentence.

## Possessive Forms

Possessive forms are derived by suffixing:

- `-i` for singular possession  
- `-oi` for plural possession  

| Subject | Singular Possessive | Plural Possessive |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Me      | **Mei** (“mine”)    | **Moi** (“ours”)  |
| Ne      | **Nei** (“yours”)   | **Noi** (“yours”) |
| Se      | **Sei** (“its”)     | **Soi** (“theirs”)|
| Re      | **Rei** (“its”)     | **Roi** (“theirs”)|

## Object Forms (Accusative)

Object forms are created by replacing the final `e` with `er`.

| Subject | Object |
|---------|--------|
| Me      | **Mer** |
| Ne      | **Ner** |
| Se      | **Ser** |
| Re      | **Rer** |

These forms are used when the pronoun is the object of a verb.  
Example: `Tak Mer` – “Do me.”

## Notes

- Mnsr pronouns do not reflect gender, animacy, or social rank.  
- The system is designed to be consistent, logical, and minimal.  
- All derivations are regular and productive.
